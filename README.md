# assoc-aSPU
Advanced longitudinal association tests including aSPU family tests for set-based markers in human genetics.
The asymptotic tests including Score, SSU, SSU weighted, UminP and Sum Tests.
The aSPU family tests are based on simulation or permutation methods. 

The program is supposed to run under linux HPC/HTC with extensive parallel computing support. Code are highly optimized to enable fast sort, fast join, mutatable object, loop structure, memory utilization, etc.
